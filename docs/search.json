    "text": "December 2024\nDuring the last week of school, my roommates and I decided to make a recipe we had never tried previously. Our menu for the night was Hickory roasted ham, Mashed potaotes, brussel sprouts and cinnamon buns! Below are the recipies for each of the meals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Ham:\n\n1 (8-10 lbs) bone-in ham\n1 cup hickory wood chips (soaked in water for 30 minutes)\n2 tbsp olive oil\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nFor the Honey Glaze:\n\n1 cup honey\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n1/4 cup Dijon mustard\n1/4 cup apple cider vinegar\n2 tbsp soy sauce\n1 tsp ground cinnamon\n1 tsp ground cloves\n1/2 tsp ground ginger\n1/2 tsp ground black pepper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).\n\n\n\n\nPat the ham dry with paper towels.\nRub the ham with olive oil, salt, and pepper to season the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a saucepan over medium heat, combine the honey, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and black pepper.\nStir the ingredients together and bring to a simmer.\nLet the glaze simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace the soaked hickory wood chips in a smoker box or directly on the grill.\nPut the ham in the smoker or on the grill over indirect heat. Smoke for 2-3 hours, basting occasionally with the honey glaze.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the ham has been smoked, transfer it to the oven. Roast for an additional 1-1.5 hours, basting with the honey glaze every 30 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 140°F (60°C).\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the ham from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving.\nServe with your favorite sides and enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a crispy outer layer, increase the temperature to 400°F during the last 10 minutes of roasting.\nLeftovers can be sliced and used for sandwiches or added to soups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 pounds russet potatoes (about 4 large potatoes)\n1/2 cup unsalted butter\n1 cup whole milk (or heavy cream for extra richness)\nSalt, to taste\nFreshly ground black pepper, to taste\n2 cloves garlic (optional)\nChopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes for even cooking.\nIf you like garlic mashed potatoes, you can add the garlic cloves, peeled, to the pot while boiling the potatoes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace the potatoes (and garlic, if using) in a large pot and cover with cold water.\nAdd a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat.\nReduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the potatoes are cooked, drain them in a colander and return them to the pot.\nIf you added garlic, remove it from the pot.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a potato masher or a potato ricer to mash the potatoes to your desired consistency.\nFor ultra-smooth potatoes, you can use a ricer, which will give them a silky texture.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the butter to the mashed potatoes and stir until fully melted and incorporated.\nGradually pour in the milk (or heavy cream), stirring until the potatoes are creamy and smooth.\nAdd salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransfer the mashed potatoes to a serving dish and garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.\nServe warm and enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved\n2 tbsp olive oil\n2 tbsp maple syrup\n1 tbsp balsamic vinegar\nSalt, to taste\nFreshly ground black pepper, to taste\n1/4 tsp garlic powder (optional)\n1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)\nChopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)\nBacon (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n\n\n\n\nTrim the ends of the Brussels sprouts and remove any yellow or damaged outer leaves.\nCut them in half lengthwise to ensure even cooking.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a large bowl, toss the halved Brussels sprouts with olive oil, salt, pepper, and optional garlic powder and red pepper flakes.\nMake sure the Brussels sprouts are evenly coated with oil and seasonings.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrizzle the maple syrup and balsamic vinegar over the Brussels sprouts, then toss again to coat evenly.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpread the Brussels sprouts in a single layer on a baking sheet, cut side down for crispiness.\nRoast in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the Brussels sprouts are golden brown and crispy on the edges. Stir halfway through for even roasting.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove from the oven and garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired.\nServe warm and enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 cup warm milk (110°F/45°C)\n2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast (1 packet)\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted\n1/2 tsp salt\n2 eggs\n4 cups all-purpose flour\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n\n\n\n\n\n1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened\n3/4 cup packed brown sugar\n2 tbsp ground cinnamon\n1/4 tsp salt\n\n\n\n\n\n4 oz cream cheese, softened\n1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened\n1 1/2 cups powdered sugar\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1-2 tbsp milk (for consistency)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the warm milk and granulated sugar.\nSprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a large bowl, combine the melted butter, salt, eggs, and vanilla extract.\nAdd the yeast mixture and mix well.\nGradually add the flour, 1 cup at a time, stirring to combine until a soft dough forms.\nKnead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic (you can do this by hand or with a stand mixer).\nForm the dough into a ball, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a small bowl, combine the softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt to create the filling.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).\nOnce the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out into a rectangle (about 16x12"

There is a European feel to the atmosphere and the food scene is endless. Below I will share some of my trip highlights. I only got the chance to stay here for a day, so I was unable to do a lot of sight-seeing, however, the places I managed to see were show-stopping!\n\n\nDuring one of the days in Montreal, I took a hike up the Mont Royal Mountain. This steep mountain is is part of the Monteregian Hills situated between Laurentians and the Appalachain Mountains. Located in the downtown area, this hike will take you around 1-2 hours. This destination is popular around the fall and summer time. This time, I was able to see all the different coloured leaves which made beautiful pictures. Out of all the hikes I have taken in my lifetime, this was quite difficult, however, there are some places to rest if you get tired."

    "text": "October 2024\nLast year, I took a trip to Halifax, Nova Scotia with my Aunt and Uncle. It was one of my most favourite experiences as I got a chance to live in the Maritime provinces for a short amount of time. When I was younger my family and I often traveled to various places around Canada including the east coast and I absolutely loved the seaside. Below I will outline some the highlights of my trip and some recommendations for future travelers!\n\n\nOne of our first stops was seeing Peggy’s Cove. This area is not too fat from city as it takes around 40 minutes. We drove by car to get to our destination which was very scenic. I highly recommend taking a road trip around Canada as there is so much to see including wildlife, landscapes etc. Peggy’s Cove is one of Nova Scotia’s prime tourist attractions. This fishing village is along the South shore and was built in 1915. You can spend the day looking at the ocean and appreciating the serenity of the atmosphere. Sometimes, if you are lucky, there are muscians that will play music and will allow you to take pictures with them! This area has been designated as a preservation region and remains a fishing community. I would highly recommend going to Sou’Western Gifts and Restaurant as the fish and chips were absolutely divine! Seafood is very prominent in Halifax, especially lobster, so if you get the chance I would try at least one seafood related dish.\n\n\n\n\nAnother place that made it to my highlights was Point Pleasant Park located in the south end of the Halifax peninsula. This spot is great for hikes during the fall and summer time. This area is also pet friendly and filled with dogs running around. We walked through the entire park and managed to catch glimpses of the ocean, and rich forestry. It was a great break from being inside all day and we managed to even catch the sunrise that day. I would highly recommend if you enjoy being out in nature!\n\n\n\n\nThe Halifax harbour is one of the most popular places downtown. Here, you can find several places to walk, shop and eat along the boardwalk. Sometimes, you can catch various individuals performing circus acts, music and plays. Along the boardwalk, there are several info boards that have a written documentation of historic events that happened in areas closeby. For those who are history junkies, I would definitely suggest reading those signs as they provide context and cultural background to some of the sites. We managed to visit one of the restaurants, Bar Sofia, which was a Mexican establishment. I had the chance to enjoy some fish tacos which were absolutely amazing!\n\n\n\n\nI would rate my trip to Halifax an 8.5/10! Again, I would recommend this destination for those who enjoy being out in nature and appreciate the seaside. There are many spots to travel in Halifax, however these are some of my favourites."

Weight gain occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure and weight loss occurs when energy expenditure surpasses energy intake. Past research has seen that as well lose weight, our resting energy expenditure decreases which makes it harder to sustain weight loss. This resistance to weight loss in known as adaptive thermogenesis where our our resting energy expenditure decreases beyond what is predicted in terms of body composition. My research focuses on adolescents with obesity and how their energy expenditure is different from other individuals. Below I will explain some of the core components of my project.\n\n\nObesity is a multifaceted condition caused by a combination fo various factors such as genetics, environment, behaviour and physiology. Behavioural causes are related to dietary and physical activity habits. High consumption of fatty foods can lead to increased weight gain. Physical inactivity can lead to sedendary lifestyles. Genetic causes are related to family history and inherited genes affecting metabolism or hormonal imbalances of insulin, leptin or cortisol. Environmental factors such as socioeconomic status may lead to purchasing unhealthy foods as they are typically cheaper in grocery stores. Additionally, certain medications such as antidepressants or medical conditions can cause obesity or weight gain as well. There are many other factors as well, however, the most important thing to recognize is that obesity is a multifactorial issue and tailored interventions are required in order to treat this condition.\n\n\n\n\n60-75% of TDEE comprises of Resting energy expenditure (resting energy expenditure is the energy expenditure while a peron lies quiety awake in an interprandial state. This is required for basic functions at rest such as keeping our organs functioning.\n15-30% consists of Physical activity energy expenditure (consists of any physical activity that is done throughout the day. Thi can be as simple as raising one’s hand to ask a question, or running on the treadmill for 30 minutes)\n10% consists of the thermic effect of food (thermic effect of food is the increase in metabolic rate that occurs after eating a meal. it is the amount of energy it takes for your body to digest and absorb the food you eat.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of treatment\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nDietary modifications\nMaking changes to your diet is normally the first treatment option for individuals with obesity. Physicians will encourage others to ensure adolescents are receiving portion-controlled meals rich in vegetables, fruits, lean proteins and whole grains. Sugary beverages and junk food high in saturated fats such as potato chips are high calorie foods which can contribute to weight gain.\n\n\nPhysical activity modifications\nAiming for at least 30-60 minutes of moderate exercise is a common recommendation for adolescents with obestiy. This can vary from high intensity swimming or reaching a certain amount of steps everyday. Including muscle strengthening exercises is also important to ensure that there is an adequate amount of muscle mass\n\n\nSleep\nHaving poor sleep patterns can be linked to obesity as sleep deprivation can disrupt hormones that regulte apptetite making an individual feel more hungrier and likely to engage in food consumption\n\n\nBehavioural therapy\nEngaging family members to create a supportive environemnt for behaviour change can also be helpful. Sometimes, parents or family are unaware of the food decisions that are made for their children. By suggesting strategies to help with this, parents can attempt to create a safe environment for their children. Additionally, sometimes feeding pattern are linked to thought patterns. It is thus important to change and recognize these patterns.\n\n\nPharmacological treatments\nFor adolescents with severe obesity, medication may considered. For example, semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist is a type of medication that is used for weight loss by decreasing appetite and energy intake. Wegovy, the brand name of semaglutide, has recently been approved for pediatric use from 12 years old.\n\n\nSurgery\nFor adolescents with severe obestiy and other complications such as type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, surgical treatment is an option. Common procedures include Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and sleeve Gastrectomy. These procedures are invasive so it is important to consult a physician in order to be fully informed of the risks of this procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe focus of my project involves examining how energy expenditure changes in response to a pharmacological treatment of semaglutide in adolescents with obesity. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1), including semaglutide, have emerged as adjacent treatments to suppress appetite and promote weight loss4. In one of the few studies examining pharmacotherapeutic effects on EE, adults with obesity and T2D treated for one year with both metformin and a GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) had a greater EE for fat free mass than those treated with metformin alone. This study suggests that the addition of a GLP-1 RA may protect against decreases in EE following weight loss5. However, as this research was exclusively conducted in adults, this relationship remains unexplored in adolescents. Using new state of the art whole calorimetry rooms we will measure energy expenditure using these rooms at McMaster Children’s Hospital."

    "text": "AmazingAthena\nWelcome to my very first blog! This is a place where I will upload my daily activities including my travel adventures, school days and anything else related to my life! Stay a while and get to know me!\n\n\nAbout Me\nMy name is Athena! I am currently a first year Masters student studying Medical Sciences at McMaster University. The courses I am taking this year are GEOG 712: Reproducibility in Research and MED SCI 771: Research Methodology in Basic Health Science. I am currently conducting research the lab of Dr. Katherine Morrison speicalizing in the pediatric obesity. Our research is related to energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis. Adaptive thermogenesis is the body’s metabolic adaptation to weight loss where an individual’s resting energy expenditure decreases as one loses more weight. This can cause cycles of weight regain, increasing risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our research measured energy expenditure using whole room calorimetry in our energy lab in HSC. This brand new state of the art room allows us to measure oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and using a validated equation, we can then use this to derive energy expenditure. Aside from my education, I love to hangout with my friends and spend time with my family. I love to watch movies and some of my favourites include watching the Marvel franchise."
